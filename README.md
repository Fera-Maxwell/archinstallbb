# archinstallbb (But Better) :3c

An Arch Linux installer that actually works. No bloat, no Python, just pure Bash.

### Features
- **Smart Partitioning:** Automatically handles BIOS/UEFI, GPT/MSDOS, and Role assignment.
- **Space-Fixer:** Type user groups with spaces or commas; it doesn't care.
- **Bootloader Choice:** Choose between GRUB, Limine, or "Soldier Mode" (None).
- **Easter Eggs:** Includes 100% more "Deez nutz" jokes than the official installer.

### Usage
1. Boot the Arch ISO.
2. `curl -LO https://github.com/Fera-Maxwell/archinstallbb/raw/refs/heads/main/archinstallbb`
3. `chmod +x archinstallbb && mv archinstallbb /usr/bin/`
4. `sudo archinstallbb`
